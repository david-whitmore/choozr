# Shuffle
Shuffles the lines of a plain text file, and outputs the first __n__.
Could be used as part of a 'dice life' system, or for 'random acts of kindness'.

Linux already has something like this: shuf.  However, I wanted something that I could use on Windows too.

Syntax is:
shuffle &lt;number of lines to choose&gt; &lt;plain text file to choose from&gt;
